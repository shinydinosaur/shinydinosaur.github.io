Shiry Ginosar is an Assistant Professor at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), where she works at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. She earned her B.Sc. from Carnegie Mellon University and her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. Following her Ph.D., she was a Computing Innovation postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley's EECS department and the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. Shiry then spent a couple of years at Google DeepMind as a Visiting Faculty Researcher.

Shiry's research explores grounded visual understanding, with particular contributions to social behavior prediction, visual data mining, and video synthesis. Her work is driven by a central question: how can we understand human and artificial intelligence one pixel at a time? While rooted in machine perception, her approach is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing from Psychology, Neuroscience, and the arts.
